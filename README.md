## Welcome to the Technical Task for the QA Engineer role at Sport Buff



#### We want you to create a simple webdriver test in Selenium, or any other Web Testing Tool you like, that should perform the following tests: 



1. Check that the webpage at https://demo.sportbuff.com/ is running
2. Fill in a **random email and name** and start the demo 
3. Check that the demo page loads
4. Check that a video is playing in the demo page
5. Verify that the SportBuff UI is loaded (compact points view is visible)
6. Verify that the entered Name in the form is present in the Leaderboard as our username
7. We can update our name in the profile section
8. We can see our email address in the Profile section
9. We can update our email in the Profile section



**Please note that the test is generating at each run a random email and name and not reuse the same.**

**No cookies should be saved as the demo page is storing data there and won't prompt for a username and email if a cookie is found**
