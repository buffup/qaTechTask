## Welcome to the Technical Task for the QA Engineer role at Sport Buff



#### We want you to create a simple automation test in any Web Testing Tool you like, that should perform the following tests: 


1. Check that the webpage at https://demo.sportbuff.com/?videoID=Tennis_Channel_Demo is running
2. Fill in a **random email and name** and start the demo 
3. Check that the demo page loads
4. Check that a video is playing in the demo page
5. Verify that the SportBuff UI is loaded (compact points view is visible)
6. We can update our name in the profile section
7. We can update our email in the Profile section
8. A random vote can be casted to the Questions (Buffs) that appears at random intervals and you don't receive an API error response

**Please note that the test must be generating at each run a random email and name and not reuse the same values on a next iterration.**
**No cookies should be saved as the demo page is storing data there and won't prompt for a username and email if a cookie is found**
