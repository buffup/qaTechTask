## Welcome to the Technical Task for the QA Engineer role at Sport Buff



#### We want you to create a simple automation test in any Web Testing Tool you like, that should perform the following tests: 


1. Check that the webpage at https://qa.sportbuff.com/?clientName=develop&streamId=c89e38f4-d76f-4175-9faf-1cd1c2520092 is running
2. Check that a video is playing in the demo page
3. Verify that the SportBuff UI is loaded (compact points view is visible)
4. We can update our name in the profile section
5. We can update our email in the Profile section
6. We can update our profile picture in the Profile section

**Please note that the test must be generating at each run a random email and name and not reuse the same values on a next iterration.**
